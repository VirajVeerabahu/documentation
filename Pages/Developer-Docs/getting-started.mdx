#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Embed DataBrain Dashboard**

**Step 1: Install DataBrain _NPM _Package**

Copy

```
npm install @databrainhq/plugin
```

**Step 2: Import the Plugin**

Copy

```
import '@databrainhq/plugin/web';
```

**Step 3: Use the Components in Your Application**

For embedding a Dashboard

Copy

```
<dbn-dashboard token="token" dashboard-id="dashboardId" />
```

or

For embedding a Metric Card

Copy

```
<dbn-metric token="token" metric-id="metricId" />
```

- To find dashboardId please [see here](https://docs.usedatabrain.com/developer-docs/helpers/dashboard-id).
- To find metricId please [see here](https://docs.usedatabrain.com/developer-docs/helpers/metric-id).

**Token**

The `token` should be a guest token, fetched from your backend based on the current user's login information. You can see more [about it here.](https://docs.usedatabrain.com/developer-docs/token)

Here is an example with sample token and dashboardId that you can use in your frontend app to get started without a backend.

Copy

```
<dbn-dashboard token="3affda8b-7bd4-4a88-9687-105a94cfffab" dashboard-id="ex-demo" />
```
