title: "Embed Functions"

You can add your own buttons with embed functions.

To integrate and make use of specific **embed functions** within the `dbn-dashboard` component, you first need to locate the component with dbn-dashboard className on the webpage.

Copy

```
const dbnDashboard = document.querySelector(
    'dbn-dashboard'
  )?.shadowRoot?.querySelector('.dbn-dashboard') as HTMLElement & {
    onClickCreateMetric?: () => void;
    onClickManageMetrics?: () => void;
    onClickScheduleReports?: () => void;
    onClickCustomizeLayout?: () => void;
  };
```

Now you can add the buttons on your screen with these specific functions in **onClick** event of those buttons, here's an example:

Copy

```
<Button type="button" onClick={() => dbnDashboard?.onClickCreateMetric?.()}>
  Create Metric
</Button>
```

There are four functions provided by the embed.

- Copy

  ```
  onClickCreateMetric(): It will open the create metric modal.
  ```
- Copy

  ```
  onClickManageMetrics(): It will open the manage metrics modal.
  ```
- Copy

  ```
  onClickScheduleReports(): It will open the schedule reports modal.
  ```
- Copy

  ```
  onClickCustomizeLayout(): It will enable the customize layout mode.
  ```

**Note**: The functions will work only if you haven't disabled the respective operations. Also you need to disable the **showDashboardActions **in**options**  in**dbn-dashboard ** component**, **if you don't want to see the buttons provided by it that perform these actions and want to customize the buttons yourself.
