When self hosted version of the app is used, the app needs to use these settings during embedding.

To change the configs we need to add some changes -

Where we are importing the plugin in the same file -

Copy

```
import "@databrainhq/plugin/web";

window.dbn = {
  baseUrl: SELFHOSTED_URL,
};
```

Assign configs in the `window.dbn` object. baseUrl - The base API endpoint e.g. https://api.example.com, https://yourdomain.com, etc.

You may face typescript errors while assigning to `window.dbn` this can be resolved by adding the below code to any global `d.ts` file

Copy

```
interface Window {
  dbn: Record<string, string>;
}
```
